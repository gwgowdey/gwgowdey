Greetings! Welcome to my GitHub page. :computer:

My name is Griffin Gowdey, and I'm currently a part-time virtual student at Tarrant County College in Fort Worth, Texas. I'm studying IT: Programming and will be completing a Level 2 Certificate/Associate of Applied Science degree in Fall 2021. I'm also an evening part-time virtual Math Tutor with their Northeast Campus Math and Physics Learning Center. My work schedule is Monday through Friday from 5 PM to 8 PM and Saturday from 10 AM to 4 PM. 

Here is the list of courses that I'll be taking there:

<b>Fall 2020</b>:
COSC 1436 - Programming Fundamentals I+ (C++), COSC 1437 - Programming Fundamentals II+ (C++), ITSE 2417 - Java Programming (Java), and ITSE 1479 - Intro to Scripting Languages (Python).

<b>Spring 2021</b>:
ITSE 1450 - System Analysis and Design (Capstone/Final Project. HTML, CSS, C++, and Python), COSC 2436 - Programming Fundamentals III+ (Data Structure and Algorithms. C++ and Java), and ITSE 2409 - Database Programming (SQL).

<b>Summer 2021</b>:
ITNW 1425 - Fundamentals of Networking Technologies, ITSC 1425 - Personal Computer Hardware, and ITSY 1300 - Fundamentals of Information Security.

<b>Fall 2021</b>:
COSC 1301 - Introduction to Computing+ or BCIS 1305 - Business Computer Applications+ and ITSC 1305 - Introduction to PC Operating Systems.

My most recent full-time position was eliminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Having gained some IT skills from past positions, I decided to expand upon that prior IT experience and pursue software engineering as my career choice. I'm currently in the job market and actively applying for any full-time technical position that would allow me to supplement my current educational pursuits.

I plan to use my GitHub as a showcase/portolio for potential future employers. Please visit the Resume-and-Career-Summary repository that is pinned to my profile if you'd like to know more in-depth about my background.
